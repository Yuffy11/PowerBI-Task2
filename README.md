The screenshot shows cleaned and transformed data. The steps carried out in cleaning and transforming the data were;

1. Check Title Case: Ensure that the "Title" column uses proper case, which means capitalizing the first letter of each word.

2. Assess Data Quality: Assessing the quality of the data involves checking for errors, inconsistencies, and missing values using the column profile to determine errors. 

3. Spellcheck: Search for and correct any misspelled words in the dataset. This step is crucial for maintaining data accuracy and reliability.

4. Merge or Delete Columns: Evaluate if there are any redundant or unnecessary columns in the dataset. Decide whether to merge certain columns or eliminate ones that don't contribute to the analysis.

#### Conclusion:
The ultimate objective of data cleaning is to achieve a dataset that is not only accurate but also consistent. This task serves as a valuable learning experience, highlighting the significance of data cleaning and transformation.

By successfully implementing data cleaning steps, the result is a dataset that can provide meaningful insights crucial for informed decision-making and analysis.
